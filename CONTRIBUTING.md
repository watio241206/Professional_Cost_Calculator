## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Java Conventions
```java
// Class names: PascalCase
public class CostCalculationEngine

// Method names: camelCase
public void calculateAdvancedCost()

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
private static final double DEFAULT_TAX_RATE = 0.08;

// Variables: camelCase
double totalCost = calculateTotal();
```

#### Documentation Standards
```java
/**
 * Calculates advanced cost with tax and discount processing.
 * 
 * @param costPerItem Cost per individual item (must be positive)
 * @param quantity Number of items (must be >= 1)
 * @param deliveryCost Delivery charges (must be non-negative)
 * @param taxRate Tax rate as decimal (0.0 to 1.0)
 * @param discountRate Discount rate as decimal (0.0 to 0.5)
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any parameter is invalid
 * @since 2.0
 */
public void calculateAdvancedCost(double costPerItem, int quantity, 
                                double deliveryCost, double taxRate, double discountRate) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Error Handling
```java
try {
    // Financial calculation operation
    validateAndSetCostPerItem(costPerItem);
    performCalculation();
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    // Graceful handling with user-friendly message
    System.err.println("‚ùå Validation Error: " + e.getMessage());
    // Provide guidance for correction
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test with basic calculation mode (no tax)
- [ ] Test with standard calculation mode (8% tax)
- [ ] Test with advanced calculation mode (custom tax & discount)
- [ ] Test with edge cases (minimum values, maximum discounts)
- [ ] Test with invalid inputs (negative values, excessive rates)
- [ ] Test currency formatting with various amounts
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

#### Test Cases to Include
```bash
# Basic functionality
java Professional_Cost_Calculator.CostCalculatorApplication
# Mode 1: Basic calculation

# Advanced features
java Professional_Cost_Calculator.CostCalculatorApplication
# Mode 3: Advanced with 15% tax, 10% discount

# Edge cases
java Professional_Cost_Calculator.CostCalculatorApplication
# Test with minimum cost (0.01), maximum discount (50%)

# Error conditions
# Test with negative costs, invalid tax rates, excessive discounts
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Calculation Efficiency**: Maintain O(1) time complexity for all operations
- **Memory Usage**: Minimize object creation in calculation loops
- **Currency Formatting**: Cache NumberFormat instances for performance
- **Input Validation**: Fail fast with clear error messages

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Adding New Features

#### Currency Support
```java
// Add new currency formatting options
private static final NumberFormat USD_FORMAT = 
    NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.US);
private static final NumberFormat EUR_FORMAT = 
    NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.GERMANY);
```

#### Tax Calculation Enhancements
```java
// Extend tax calculation with regional rates
public void calculateRegionalTax(String region, double amount) {
    double regionalRate = TaxRateProvider.getRate(region);
    // Apply regional tax calculation logic
}
```

#### Reporting Features
```java
// Add new report generation methods
public String generatePDFReport() {
    // PDF generation logic using libraries like iText
}

public String generateCSVReport() {
    // CSV export functionality for data analysis
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

- Maintain existing method signatures for core functionality
- Preserve output format for basic calculation modes
- Add new features as optional enhancements without breaking changes
- Document any breaking changes in version notes
